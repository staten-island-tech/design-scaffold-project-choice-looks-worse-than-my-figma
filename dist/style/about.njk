    <p>My name is Jonathan Wong and I am a food blogger with a masters degree in farming at Cornell. My favorite hobby is cooking and my favorite ingridients to use are potatoes and chickens. I often go out and visit many restaurants because I am a foodie and I like to get inspiration for my "own" recipes.</p>
