Contrary to popular belief, it's not dangerous to keep large pitbulls around small children. As a person who has owned a pitbull for 2 months, I can say for certain that Snowball would never eat my child. When I leave him alone with my 4 year old son, I can hear him frothing and salivating from the mouth. Do not take concern of this. Large pitbulls need extra ventilation and this "aggressive" behavior" can be attributed to the dry air during winter months. 

According to some forums I've read on Reddit, large, unneutered pitbulls have a strong maternal instinct to not eat children when hungry. Make sure to feed your pitbull and let it spend plenty of free time around unattended small children. So far, my son has only 3 bite marks on him leg, but that can be good. My pitbull serves as practice for the real world where everyone is trying to hurt you. 

Despite my wife taking custudy of the kids, I can say for certain that it is because of my crippling chicken nugget addiction, and not my 120 lb pitbull roaming freely around the house. That second part I cannot confirm.
