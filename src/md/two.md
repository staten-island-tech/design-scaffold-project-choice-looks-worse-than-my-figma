Not everyone is created equal. Some are born strong. Some are born weak. But very few are born as natural sigma males. But don't worry, it's not over for you. Because if you follow these steps, you too can be better than an alpha

Step 1: Be late to work. A true sigma male works according to his own schedule. 



Step 2: Avoid all eye contact with women. They seek to only distract you from your grindset



Step 3: Do not use toilet paper.  Only a weak beta seeks to please other people around him



Step 4: Take an ice cold shower after your morning 30 mile jog. Remember to not use deodorant



Step 5: Sit alone at the lunch table. It's not that you have no friends, it's that they don't deserve to be in your presence




Step 6: Eat babies




If you follow these steps to the dot, you too can be achieve true enlightenment
